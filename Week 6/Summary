Week 6: Created Data Ingestion Pipeline. Used CSV file containing information about chess games. 

Check computational efficiency of various methods to read large CSV files. Then, listed number of rows and columns.
Then I validated the columns, making sure there were no whitespace.

I then made a YAML file containing the columns, and validated they contained the right information.

Finally, I wrote the file in pipe separated text file (|), in gz format.
